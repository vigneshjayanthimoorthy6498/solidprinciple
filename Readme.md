Single Responsibility Principle
---
 A class should have only one reason to change

Open Closed Principle
---
Software Entities (classes, interface,  modules) should be open for extension and closed for modification

Liskov Substitution Principle
---
Object of the superclass should be replaced with objects of its subclass without breaking the system

Interface Segregation Principle
---
Client should not be forced to depend on the interface they don't use

Dependency Inversion Principle
---
Higher-Level Modules should not  depend on lower-level modules. Both should be depend on the abstraction
